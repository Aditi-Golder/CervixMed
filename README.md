## Paper Title: 
CervixMed: Detecting Cervical Cancer based on combinational data using Hybrid architecture.

### Abstract:
<div style="text-align:justify">
Cervical cancer is women’s second most frequent
malignancy globally, with a 60% mortality rate. Early identifica-
tion through routine checkups is crucial because cervical cancer
has a long latent period and begins with no overt signs. One
of the most evident barriers to not having an early detection is
the time required for the diagnostic process, which also accounts
for indifference regarding its automation. These uncertainties
occur for several reasons, while one of the most prominent
causes is providing the report by the computer-aided diagnostic
process only based on the patient’s information in tabular form
or only predicting the patient’s cervix image. In this study, we
proposed three concepts 1. Hybrid Architecture, 2. CervixMed,
a novel CNN-based architecture, and 3. GUI (Graphical User
Interface). In Hybrid Architecture, we propose a methodology
that takes both types of data, i.e., tabular and image, and then
merges the prediction provided by the models and shows the
final output. For tabular data classification, we use traditional-
machine learning models like KNN, SVM, LR, and RF, where
LR and SVM provided the best accuracy of 99%. On the other
hand, the image data is classified into one of the five categories
using our novel lightweight CNN-based architecture, CervixMed,
that outperforms other pre-trained models like DenseNet121,
DenseNet169, DenseNet201, ResNet152v2, and VGG19 by 94%
in accuracy and 98% in sensitivity. The hybrid architecture
combines the abovementioned models and chooses the best
pair regarding accuracy. In this study, we demonstrated that
combining LR and SVM with CervixMed outperforms the other
combinations by 96.5% accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrated the
methodology of the proposed GUI for interacting with the end-
users with this hybrid model.
